# Gender-Based-Violence Dashboard

## Overview

Gender-based violence (GBV) is a global issue affecting vulnerable communities worldwide. 
KenyaPulse’s commitment to uplifting impoverished communities within Nairobi compelled its
strategic goals to combat GBV. By identifying hotspots, understanding vulnerabilities, evaluating
program impact, and advocating for policy changes, this dashboard aims to fulfil KenyaPulse’s mission.

## Strategic Goals

Following are KenyaPulse’s strategic goals and its following impacts:

### 1. To raise GBV awareness within the urban slums community
This effort is crucial as it encourages societal dialogue, which in turn spreads awareness about the
prevalence and consequences of GBV. The National Crime Research Centre’s (2014) studies indicate
that Kenyans have a general understanding of GBV but with notable gaps in awareness concerning
certain types of violence and child victimization. The prevalent perception among both genders was
that GBV involves physical harm by men against women. However, other forms of GBV such as abuse
of children or psychological harm, were less recognized.

### 2. To be an advocate of policy changes.
Kenyan authorities fail to ensure that GBV survivors have access to quality medical treatment,
including mental health, protection services, and financial aid, and to thoroughly investigate and
prosecute cases (Human Rights Watch 2021). Despite Kenya adopting treaties, such as the UN
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and enacting
national laws like the Sexual Offences Act to criminalize violence against women, activists argue that
government policies remain largely ineffective. There are no government-backed national campaigns
addressing GBV or its consequences, and the justice system is criticized for its slow and inefficient
prosecution of offenders (Lawal, S 2024).

### 3. To facilitate access to support services
This ensures that individuals affected by gender-based violence have access to essential support
services such as healthcare and education. This initiative aims to bridge the gap in service delivery,
providing tangible services that directly benefit survivors and contribute to their recovery and
empowerment.

### 4. To empower affected communities
KenyaPulse is committed to providing education initiatives and leadership development programs as
it seeks to offer opportunities for skill-building, mentorship, and other forms of support. The
organization would like to enable individuals to amplify their voices, fostering a culture of solidarity
and empowerment within the community.

## Ethical Considerations and Privacy

Ethical considerations and privacy concerns are critical in data analytics through data collection,
storage, and usage. Following its values as a non-profit organisation specialising in marginalised
communities, it is especially essential that KenyaPulse complies with moral standards and the legal
obligations surrounding data. Globally, the ethical standard for organisations is to be socially
conscious, considerate throughout their data operations and comply with UNSDG principles on data
(United Nations Development Group 2017). 

In data collection, it is critical that primary data is obtained through informed consent and that 
secondary data sources are verifiable and follow ethical collection
(People in Need 2022). Furthermore, as the data was sourced primarily and on a sensitive topic like
GBV, it is important that KenyaPulse prepared analysts surveying to be emotionally considerate,
provide referral services and monitor safety (World Health Organization 2007). Teams must respect
participants’ right to privacy through the removal or encryption of identifiable information when
storing data and creating databases. Encryption also aids in cybersecurity to protect sensitive data
from unrestricted access. 

The ethical practice of fair data usage involves transparency to data owners
on its usage, companies monitoring future usage and ensuring employees cannot use the data
maliciously. KenyaPulse must also comply with Kenya’s legal requirements such as those outlined in
the Data Protection Act 2019. As a non-profit organization dedicated to empowering communities,
KenyaPulse must always consider ethical values and always prioritize community concerns.
